    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Another Italian classic. Creamy rice with earthy mushrooms.</p>
    <p>People say you need to stir this the whole time, but I've heard conflicting
      things.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Risotto rice (usually arborio)</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Mushrooms, sliced</li>
      <li>Chicken stock (or vegetable stock for a vegetarian version)</li>
      <li>White wine</li>
      <li>Parmesan</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook the mushrooms until golden. Reserve until later.</li>
      <li>Cook the onions until softened in the butter. When they are close to done,
        add the garlic and return the mushrooms to the pan.</li>
      <li>Add the rice to the pan and allow it to be coated in the fat.</li>
      <li>Deglaze the pan with the wine.</li>
      <li>When most of the wine has cooked off, start adding stock bit by bit while
        stirring. Add more stock when most of it has been absorbed by the rice.</li>
      <li>When the rice is cooked, add some more butter and a good amount of grated
        parmesan.</li>
      <li>Serve with shavings of parmesan and a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
