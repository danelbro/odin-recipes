    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic Roman pasta dish is notoriously difficult to master.</p>
    <p>It's a deliciously creamy sauce, with crisp fatty pancetta and lots of freshly
      ground black pepper, but it uses no cream; all the creaminess comes from the eggs.
    <p>Here's a method I've honed for a few years, which seems pretty authentic.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti or linguine</li>
      <li>Large eggs - for 2 servings, 3 yolks + 1 whole egg</li>
      <li>Pancetta</li>
      <li>Parmesan</li>
      <li>Pecorino</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat a pan over medium heat and cook the pancetta in a little olive oil.
        When crispy and golden, leave aside to cool, reserving some of the
        fat.</li>
      <li>Cook the pasta in well-salted water according to manufacturer's
        instructions.</li>
      <li>While the pasta is cooking, put the egg yolks and egg into a large mixing
        bowl, preferably metal. Add a good amount of finely grated parmesan and
        pecorino and freshly ground black pepper to the mix, and combine.</li>
      <li>If the bowl is metal, heat the egg mixture gently by placing the bowl on
        top of the pasta pan. Don't cook the eggs: you want them to be slightly
        warm so adding the cooked pasta to them doesnt shock them into
        scrambling.</li>
      <li>Add the reserved pancetta and a little of the fat to the egg mixture.</li>
      <li>When the pasta is cooked, reserve some of the starchy water and drain. Add
        chopped butter to the egg mixture and a splash of pasta water. Then, add
        pasta to the mixture and mix vigorously with tongs (for longer than you
        think). Add a little more pasta water if necessary until you have a creamy
        sauce which coats each strand of pasta.</li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve with grated parmesan and
        more pepper.</li>
    </ol>
