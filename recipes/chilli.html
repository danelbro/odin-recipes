    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Although it apparently does not photograph well, chilli con carne is one of my favourite meals.</p>
    <p>It's super easy to make if you want, or you can spend hours and hours on really deepening the flavour.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Beef mince</li>
      <li>Kidney beans</li>
      <li>Chopped tomatoes</li>
      <li>Onion</li>
      <li>Celery</li>
      <li>Green pepper</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>Oregano</li>
      <li>Cumin</li>
      <li>Chocolate powder</li>
      <li>Lime</li>
      <li>Coriander (to garnish)</li>
    </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
     <li>Brown the mince in a pan over medium heat. Don't touch it much to get a good
       crust on the meat. Once cooked, set aside for later.</li>
     <li>Cook the onion, celery and pepper until softened, then add garlic.</li>
     <li>Deglaze the pan with beer. When it has mostly evaporated, add tomatoes, kidney
     beans and stock.</li>
     <li>Add cayenne, cumin, oregano and chocolate. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
     <li>Ensure that everything is covered (add more water if not). Bring to the boil and
     let simmer for as long as you like - ideally 45 minutes, but the longer the better.
     Continue to top up with water as necessary.</li>
     <li>When ready to serve, add juice of a lime and salt and pepper to taste. Garnish
     with fresh coriander and serve over rice.</li>
   </ol>
